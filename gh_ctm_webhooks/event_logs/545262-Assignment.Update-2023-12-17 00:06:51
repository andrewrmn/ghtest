    [transportationNote] => The Cardiovascular Step-down Unit is a 32-bed surgical stepdown unit with telemetry monitoring.  The primary focuses are heart, lung and vascular care, but the staff are experienced in caring for any diagnosis.  We care for patients that are admitted for inpatient care from the areas of Cath lab, PACU, CVICU and the Emergency Department.  All nurses are ACLS certified.  RN s should not only be proficient in cardiac care, rhythm recognition and management but also be able to function in a fast paced, changing environment. In addition to RNs, CVSU has a staff of patient care assistants, health unit coordinators, and cardiac monitor readers who work together to provide quality care to our various patient populations.  Additional members of the care team are exercise specialists who perform cardiac rehab and supplemental focused education before discharge. A social worker and a case manager are assigned to each patient for a smooth transition from admission to discharge. Travelers will be the first to float based on facility need.   Additional Information:Agency staff will be the first to float based on facility census and needs.   Position Urgency:Normal Billing string = The Christ Hospital
