Overland Park Regional Medical Center has been serving the healthcare needs of Johnson County and the surrounding counties since December of 1978. The hospital is a licensed 343-bed facility offering acute medical care services to our patients. The hospital campus features four medical office buildings, two pharmacies and the offices of more than 100 physicians.

Values:




Integrity
  We must model high, ethical standards, which means doing the right thing when no one is looking and walking the talk as leaders.

Compassion
  No longer are we to live by the Golden Rule, but rather we are to live and operate by the Platinum Rule, which is to treat people how they want to be treated and being responsive to their needs.

Always
  We are focused on creating a Culture of Always. This means every patient, every time and every touch. Always. Not Sometimes, Not Usually. Always.

Respect
  It is imperative to demonstrate respect and teamwork to each and every employee, while focusing on patient-centered care.

Excellence
  When you add the first four values together (Integrity, Compassion, Always and Respect), we will be the destination of Excellence and our metrics and indicators will prove it.
