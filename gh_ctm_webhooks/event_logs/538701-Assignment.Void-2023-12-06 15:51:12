5. The RNFA has a working knowledge of methods of providing hemostasis. Utilizes the following techniques appropriately and properly: 
  
5.1 Manual hemostasis
  

5.2 Instruments for homeostasis including hemostasis, clips, and vascular devices. 
  
5.3 Chemical agents such as gelatin sponge, collagen sponge, oxidized cellulose, microfibrillar collagen, and topical bovine thrombin. 
  
5.4 Electrosurgery 
  
5.5 LASER surgery 
  
6. The RNFA has a working knowledge of wound closure 
  
6.1 Performs or assists suturing techniques: continuous, interrupted, subcuticular, simple, purse string, retention, figure-8, staples, skin closure tapes, knot-tying techniques. 
  
6.2 Plans appropriately for suture materials and needle types.
  

7. Assists in the care of equipment and supplies to insure availability when needed
