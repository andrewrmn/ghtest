                                $165 -  	Schedule:  Days and times expected to work Four 10 hour shifts.  Hours may be day shift beginning at 0730 - 6pm or they may be evening hours. Flexibility would be very helpful.   I am hesitant to provide a specific time due to varying needs of the department. 	There is on-call:  Approximately 4 in a 6 week schedule.  It may vary depending on staff available for call as well.  It may adjust up or down slightly.  Week night call is 2300-0700.  Weekend call varies but the longest shift is a 12 hour call. 	Any special skill set needed?  PACU with complex care, ACLS, Post op phase II would be helpful.
