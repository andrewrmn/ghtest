Cowpens Elementary School.
Caseload range from 25- max of 60 (currently in 30s, but fluid).
Serves 4K-5th grade (potential addition of 3 year old walk in appointments if identified through Child Find).
MUST HAVE SC SLP LICENSE
Can you work with a SLP that has a pending Educators certification? Possibly  would have to verify with HR and would also depend on where they were in application process.
ONSITE ONLY
Prefer CCC  do not have the manpower for supervision of SLPA or CF.
Bill rate: $88 (flexibility through RFP range but $88 is great for SC so let's start there)
