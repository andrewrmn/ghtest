I love that Sharon works with my schedule so I can be home with my family and always supporting me. I can tell you several times that she has worked with me when I needed it most and I've never forgotten it. We all know nursing has its own challenges, but everyone I work with here helps out and works as a team! We all just click! That's basically why I stay and renew. I get to do what I love, be with my family away from work and be with my family at work."
