      About Medical City Arlington
We would like to take this opportunity to introduce you to Medical City Arlington. Originally opened in August 1976 as Arlington Community Hospital in a rural part of town, Medical City Arlington has developed into a 382-bed full-service hospital located in the heart of the growing South Arlington area. There are well over 1,000 full-time and part-time nurses, therapists, technicians and other healthcare personnel that make up our team. Medical City Arlington is proud to be a leader in Dallas/Fort Worth healthcare with nearly 600 highly skilled physicians who represent a wide variety of medical specialties. Together we form a team that is focused on high-quality care delivered safely in an environment filled with compassion and service.

In many respects there is not much difference when you compare hospitals based on bricks and mortar and to some extent when comparing technologies available for diagnosis and treatment. We recognize and thrive on the fact that what sets us apart from other hospitals in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex is our culture. We define our culture.

It starts with how we treat and interact with each other. We support each other. We communicate well. And we make sure that our team has the tools and resources it needs to be able to deliver excellent patient care. We create a workplace where doctors and nurses want to be because they know they are doing meaningful work with a purpose. This matters most to our patients and their families and our community as a whole who know they can trust us to help them get better.
