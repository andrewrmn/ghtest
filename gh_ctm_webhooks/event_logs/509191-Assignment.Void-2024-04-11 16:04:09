    [orderNote] => These are all 40 hour week positions with time built into the schedule for paperwork--no duty assignments. 
	All caseloads are approximately 60-65 students. 
	All schools potentially have a range of general education students needing speech/language therapy as well as 1-2 self contained school-aged special education classes. 
	Some elementary schools may also have 1-2 pre-k special education classes. 
	Please understand that the exact school placements are not clearly defined yet. 
	Those specific determinations will be made mid to late July when the district completes transitioning students to the next grade levels in our system. 
	Any potential candidates will need to be flexible in understanding that accepting a position may mean that I am not able to tell them the exact school location at this time.
