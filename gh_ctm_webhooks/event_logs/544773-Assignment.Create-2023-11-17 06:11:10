4 West is the acute and intermediate care unit for UVA s Thoracic, Cardiac, and Vascular (TCV) surgical patient population. TCV surgery patients are admitted for procedures including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), cardiac valve repair and replacement, AAA repair, lung resection, esophagectomy, heart and lung transplant, limb amputations, femoral popliteal bypass, and carotid endarterectomy. The nurse-patient ratio is 4 or 5:1 in acute care and 3:1 in TIMU.

4 West is 30-bed unit which includes 18 acute-care beds and a 12-bed TCV Intermediate Care Unit (TIMU). The TIMU provides care for TCV patients who do not need the intense ICU environment of our CVICU (formerly TCV Post Op unit,) yet need more advanced monitoring than an acute-care bed.
TIMU patients include, but are not limited to, fresh lobectomies, patients receiving the thrombolytic TPA, AAA, CABG/Valve and Lung transplants. Some patients are direct admits from PACU, while other come from the CVICU (formerly TCVICU) unit. TIMU can also accommodate patients on select cardiac drips and art lines.
