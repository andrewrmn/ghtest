About Metropolitan Methodist Hospital
At Metropolitan, we recognize the unique needs of each of our patients and strive to deliver the golden standard of care that Methodist has become known for regionally and nationally each and every day. That s our promise to you. Because we are part of Methodist Healthcare, we embrace the organization s mission of  Serving Humanity to Honor God. 

With our Metropolitan Methodist Hospital women s pavilion, the only stand-alone facility in downtown San Antonio dedicated to the health of women and their newborn babies, we earned an excellent reputation, one baby at a time. Our health for life center consistently makes a difference through life-changing weight loss surgery. The recent addition of a robotic surgery system is a prime example of how we are integrating new technology to better serve your needs.

When you or a loved one must be hospitalized, Metropolitan Methodist Hospital is here to offer outstanding heart and cancer care, general surgery, neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, obstetrics and gynecology services, inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services, sleep disorder evaluation and the largest emergency room in downtown San Antonio.

I consider the talented doctors and staff on the Metropolitan Methodist Hospital team part of my family and I hope you will too.
