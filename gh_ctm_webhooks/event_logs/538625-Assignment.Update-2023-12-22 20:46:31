 General CommentsSummertime      in St. Louis     The
St. Louis Cardinals
at       Busch Stadium   Often       regarded as William Shakespeare s greatest comedy,
Twelfth       Night
is bursting with romance, music and high times.
 This       year s
Shakespeare       in the Park
sets Viola and her shipwrecked twin brother         separated and finding their way in a strange, new land   in glamorous,       celebrity-filled Miami. In a world of appearances, not everyone is who       they seem, but love is love in this glorious, Latin-inflected story of       longing and reinvention.
 Part of the St. Louis Shakespeare       Festival, all performances are free and open to the public.   The       Missouri Botanical Garden is an idyllic place to listen to live music. On       Wednesday evenings throughout the summer, the garden hosts free, open-air       concerts as part of the annual
Whitaker Music Festival.
 To date, more than       one million people have participated in the cherished St. Louis       tradition, which promotes common heritage, celebrates diversity and       encourages vitality within the community. Visitors can bring their own       picnics, and food, beer, wine and sno-cones will also be available for       purchase.
