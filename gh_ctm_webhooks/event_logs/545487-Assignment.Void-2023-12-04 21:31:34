About Methodist Children's Hospital
Methodist Children s Hospital is the first hospital in San Antonio to be exclusively designed for child care. Our facility offers outstanding pediatric services in many specialty areas including pediatric heart surgery, pulmonology, orthopedics, neurosurgery, newborn and pediatric intensive care, oncology and emergency services.

Since 1998, we have worked to build a reputation that has made Methodist Children s Hospital the most preferred children s hospital in San Antonio. We understand that children are not just  little adults  and require a different kind of medical care. Our experienced team of medical professionals, pediatricians, nurses, child-life specialists, technicians and administrators focus on family-centered care to ensure that a child s family feels welcome and understands treatment options. We acknowledge that children are still learning and growing and that a hospital can be a fearful place for them, and we work hard to create positive healing experiences for each child and their families.

As part of Methodist Healthcare, Methodist Children s Hospital shares the organization s mission of Serving Humanity to Honor God. This is our promise to you and to our community.
