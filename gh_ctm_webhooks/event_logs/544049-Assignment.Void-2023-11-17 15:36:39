The OR RN is responsible for sterilizing and setting up the surgical tools, preparing the operating room and helping other members of the team put on their sterile gowns, gloves and masks. The RN will also clean and prepare the incision site. After the operation, the RN will bandage and stitch wounds and incisions and transport the patient to the recovery room. The RN will continue to provide care until the patient is transferred to another unit or discharged from the facility.  RN OR Cardiovascular nurses generally work in surgery centers, hospitals, clinics and private physicians offices. The work environment may be high pressure and require quick thinking and the ability to remain calm in a crisis. Surgical nurses work in a dynamic and challenging environment, taking on key roles in lifesaving surgical procedures and the surrounding care. Some surgeries last several hours and RN could spend many hours on their feet. Duties vary depending on the RN s level of expertise. The job can be very rewarding but every time the nurse enters the OR there is a possibility of losing the patient. Compassion and tact is necessary when interacting with worried patients or grieving family members.  Job Tasks and Duties of the OR Cardiovascular RN may include:  Observation and monitoring of the patient, including comfort, safety, blood pressure and heart rate using EKG equipment and notify the physician if something changes or appears wrong.
