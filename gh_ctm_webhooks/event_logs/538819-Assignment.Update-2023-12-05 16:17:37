Any additional information:

The Med/Surg unit at Spotsylvania Regional Medical Center is a fun filled, energetic atmosphere.
 The patient acuity on our unit tends to be lower, therefore our typical ratio is 6:1 which makes our mornings busy but our afternoons very manageable.
 We would love to eventually get our ratio to 5:1 and that often happens, but to be fair to all staff, I must state that it is currently 6:1.
 Our staff are always smiling and always willing to help each other out.
 We have a group messaging site which allows for quick real-time updates from coworkers and management.
 We also have a director and 4 clinical coordinators that are always on the unit and helping in any way they can.
 Our clinical coordinators are often in staffing or on the unit lending a hand to anyone needing it.
 




We have a good mix of experience with a few of our nurses having over 15-20 years of nursing experience.
 We are also new graduate friendly and enjoy helping our new nurses get started in their careers.
 We allow for self-scheduling by staff in order of HR status and we allow 4 guaranteed request off shifts per 4 week schedule period.
