About Methodist Hospital South
On July 1, 2017, South Texas Regional Medical Center became part of the Methodist Healthcare System family, the most preferred and respected healthcare provider in the area. With this change of ownership, we are now known as Methodist Hospital South. Even though our name has changed, the heart of our hospital remains; it just got a little bigger. The foundation we now stand on is faith-based and driven by our commitment to  Serving Humanity to Honor God .

Our clinical team is comprised of healthcare professionals with years of training and experience. These doctors, nurses, technicians, and support team members also bring compassion to their work. They are committed to working together to help ensure that your medical needs are anticipated and addressed.

We consider you and your family our teammates in this journey. You are our friends and our neighbors. And we remain your hometown hospital. On behalf of everyone at Methodist Hospital South, we thank you. We value your trust and will work tirelessly to exceed your expectations.

For the second consecutive period, Methodist Hospital South received a Hospital Safety Grade of  A  from independent safety watchdog organization The Leapfrog Group for our efforts to protect patients from harm and provide quality health care.
