Unit Description - 7 South is a 36-room cardiac/telemetry floor. Their focus is congestive heart failure and other comorbidities. One unique thing about the unit is the fact they are the only acute care floor trained to care for patients with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). They also see patients before and after procedures in the cath lab, with cardiac IV medications, severe arrhythmias, and cardio-renal syndrome.
