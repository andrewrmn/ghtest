Facility Overview:


























 Menorah Medical Center was first known as the Jewish Memorial Hospital and opened its doors to the community on September 7, 1931, filling the need for more and improved hospital facilities in Kansas City following World War I. Construction began on March 24, 1930 and was complete 18 months later at a seven acre site just south of Brush Creek in Kansas City, Missouri. The total cost of the original hospital was $1,275,000.00 and the total size was 97, 980 square feet. Renamed Menorah Hospital shortly after opening, the new facility quickly established a reputation for quality medical treatment and a caring approach to all who came through its doors.


























 
In 1945, plans were announced for a new addition. In 1951, 124 beds and new technology were opened in a new four-story structure. Along with these improvements, the hospital was renamed Menorah Medical Center to more accurately reflect its position in the community. 


























 A decade later another expansion provided an additional 153 private patient rooms plus expanded ancillary support. The six-story Menorah Tower was a five-year project, which increased patient care capacity 30% to a total of 430 beds. Menorah was growing its capabilities to serve patients and their families more efficiently and with greater comfort.
