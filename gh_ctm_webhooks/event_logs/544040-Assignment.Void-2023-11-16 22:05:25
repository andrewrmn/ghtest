The RN working in a neurointensive care unit may treat patients suffering from a stroke to traumatic brain injuries. The patient must be vigilantly monitored, watching for neurological decline in order to start intervention, if necessary, as soon as possible The Neuro ICU Registered Nurse may be required to perform delicate procedures such as inserting central lines and pulmonary artery catheters. The RN may also assist the physician with bedside procedures such as inserting a drain into the patient s skull to reduce pressure. Some Neuro Intensive Care Units specialize in trauma as well as neurological disease. The RN must know how to evaluate the patient with a brain injury that may impact the rest of the body as well as understanding how to treat and monitor neurological issues. The RN in this unit will constantly assess the patient s vital signs, speech capability, reflexes and responses. These patients require monitoring and observation and the RN in this unit will also use many types of monitoring equipment. Some Neuro ICU centers depend on brain oxygen monitoring, EEG, monitoring of cerebral blood flow, neruoimaging, brain tissue chemistry and intracranial pressure.  The RN in the Neuro ICU may work as part of a team because the Neuro ICU is normally staffed by many other health care professionals. Communication between team members is essential to the patient s recovery and daily meetings may be held to discuss progress and treatment plans for specific patients. RNs may have certifications in neurology and critical care in order to work in this type of unit.
