A decreased risk of a life-threatening event, decreased need for invasive monitoring, increased stability and an increased ability to participate in their own care are characteristics of the progressive care patient. The PCU RN should demonstrate the following basic competencies: Basic and advanced life support Dysrhythmia monitoring techniques, interpretation and treatment Medication dosage calculation, patient monitoring for medication effects, continuous medication infusion administration (non-titrated vasoactive agents, anti-arrhythmic agents, platelet inhibitors and/or insulin) Patient monitoring using standardized procedures for pre-, intra, and post procedures (TEE, cardiac catheterization with PCI, cardioversion, bronchoscopy, EGD, PEG placement, chest tube insertion) Recognition of the symptoms and signs of cardiopulmonary emergencies and the initiation of standardized interventions to stabilize the patient awaiting transfer to critical care.
