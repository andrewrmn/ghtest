 PCU is very much a  team player  unit.
 We all work together to deliver exceptional   care to our patients and their families.
   The employees here are honest, and embody the HCA vision to  Care like   family .
 We are often recognized for   our positive atmosphere and excellent employee engagement.
 
             Any additional information that would entice a worker to select your   unit for their assignment: 
Consider items such as new   equipment or technology, tenure and experience of staff, schedule options,   etc.    
 





 I truly feel we do not treat travel RNs any   differently than our core staff.
 The   only difference is the travel RNs will float before core staff.
 I allow self-scheduling (within reason to   balance the schedule), and we are a laid-back unit who maintains high patient   satisfaction ratings and high-quality metrics.
 We have had some travel RNs return for   extended contracts after some time away, and many travel RNs have renewed   multiple times.
 While some days are   more stressful than others, and not every shift is always a walk in the park,   we all get through it together and make sure our co-workers are taken care of   as well as the patients.
   
 





 We are a HCA facility, and with that comes   great technology.
 We are able to   complete many tasks on the iMobile devices (iPhones you pick up at the start   of each shift).
 The iMobile device allows   you to communicate easily through encrypted text to the hospitalist, nurses,   PCTs, and other ancillary departments.
   You can also view the patient s chart through Patient Keeper on your   iMobile, which is handy when you are not in front of a computer!
 
   
 





 We recently implemented MobiLab for the   collection of any specimens.
 We do not   perform our own phlebotomy on PCU, but we do collect microbiology specimens   such as MRSA screens and UAs.
 
   
 





 Wound documentation can be performed on the   iMobile device by using the iPhone camera in the wound care app, and the   photos upload to the patient s chart.
 
   
 





 There are experienced RNs on both day and   night shift, and RNs on both shift with ICU experience.
 We do have more travel RNs on night shift   vs dayshift, but there are resources on both shifts to answer any and all   questions you might have.
