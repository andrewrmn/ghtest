The RN will assess patient and family needs, develop a plan of care based on assessment, direct implementation of the plans of care for a group of patients, collaborate with the charge nurse and care team, and evaluate effectiveness of the care plan. Duties will include administration of medications, performing prescribed treatments, managing medical equipment, assisting with patient ADL (activities of daily living) including lifting, turning, and mobilizing patients. The RN assures that physiological, psychosocial, safety, learning, rehabilitative, spiritual, cultural, and self-care needs of patients and families are addressed.

It is recognized that RNs develop skills and abilities as they synthesize knowledge while moving through defined stages of learning. Evaluation is based on patient satisfaction scores, national quality measures and clinical competency and overall job performance.
