Justification:

The need is for 4 Contract Labor positions to fill the 5 ED Night RN positions that were recently vacated.
 We lost the 5 RNs due to competing hospitals, desired schedule change and a change in careers.
 We are down to 1 FT RN on the night
shift and are paying incentive dollars for at least 2 day time RNs to flip to nights and cover the vacant shifts. The approved Contract Labor positions
will stabilize the ED while we recruit and hire replacement RNs for nights.
