We are the preferred unit for many of our   surgeons, including orthopedics, neurosurgery, colorectal, general surgery,   non-maternal gynecology, urology, and more. We are also the preferred unit   for our trauma doctors. We offer a fast-paced unit, admitting and discharging   more than any other inpatient unit in the hospital. Our patient population   varies in both age and diagnosis. We are not the typical med/surg unit due to   our emphasis on surgical patients, clinical pathways, and enhanced   throughput. Our discharge record is 21 discharges in a single day. Our mascot   is a big purple dinosaur named Stu (for Surgical Trauma Unit) because we are   the  broken bones  unit.
