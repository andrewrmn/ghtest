    [transportationNote] => Description:TriStar Skyline Medical Center is a 233-bed HCA facility located in Nashville, Tennessee. The Center is home to the state's first
comprehensive stroke center
and is one of the national leaders in
neuroscience.


TriStar Skyline has earned many
awards and accreditations, including an Outstanding Achievement Award from the Commission on
Cancer, an Accredited
Chest Pain Center
with PCI by the Society of Cardiovascular Patient Care, and a Top Performer on Key Quality Measures by The Joint Commission. Staff members
say
the Center's emphasis on open communication and the many certification opportunities make them feel like valued employees.


The Center's location is close to the
Opryland/Music Valley
neighborhood of Nashville, known for its attractions like the
Grand Ole Opry
and the
Two Rivers Mansion. The facility is also about 15 minutes from
Downtown, which has endless entertainment venues and restaurants. For a place full of vibrancy and southern charm, look no further than
Music City.
