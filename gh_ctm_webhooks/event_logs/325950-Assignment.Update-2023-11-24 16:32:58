The Cath Lab is losing an RN to a leave, they will be in an operational crisis and are in dire need of help. This is going to leave only 1 nurse and it will be impossible to run 2 rooms. The traveler we had did not renew his contract.  There are currently 2 FT RN's and 1 FT Rad Tech positions posted with no viable candidates at this time.
