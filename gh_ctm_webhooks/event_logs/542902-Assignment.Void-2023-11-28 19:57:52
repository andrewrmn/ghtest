The   Telemetry &amp; Pulm Step Down Unit (Tele/Pulm) cares for patients with   moderate physiologic instability requiring support. Examples include COPD   exacerbation, pneumonia, CHF &amp; trach patients. Tele/Pulm patients are   hemodynamically stable that require cardiac &amp; respiratory monitoring   &amp; management every 2-4 hours. The level of care of the Tele/Pulm unit   requires less care than the ICU but more than that which is provided in the   Medical/Surgical Units. This unit specializes in the care of cardiac and   pulmonary patients.
   


   Procedures performed on unit:
