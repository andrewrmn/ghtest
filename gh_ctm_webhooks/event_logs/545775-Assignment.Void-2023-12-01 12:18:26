    [transportationNote] => 2 years of experience within specialty, CPR/BLS Neonatal intensive care unit registered nurses provide critical care to premature and sick newborns. In addition to providing around-the-clock care to these patients, NICU RNs offer support to the parents. This parental support can range from emotional encouragement to advising parents on how to take care of an infant when they return home. NICU RNs work as a team member with other nurse practitioners and physicians. Their prime responsibility is to ensure that a newborn's critical care treatment is secure. Education Requirements NICU RNs must hold a minimum of a Bachelor of Science in Nursing. While there is no undergraduate specialization in neonatal intensive care, some programs might include clinical experience coursework or provide internship opportunities within the NICU of a hospital. Graduates with a bachelor's degree might need to acquire a year of emergency or adult critical care before being accepted into a neonatal or NICU department--but this requirement depends upon the hospital or healthcare facility. Graduate degree programs in neonatal intensive care also exist. Most require a couple of years of real-life work experience in a NICU for admission to the program. In addition to holding a bachelor's degree, all nurses must take the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) to become licensed registered nurses. NICU RNs should also be certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Job Duties NICU RNs perform life-sustaining care. Their duties include administering medications, monitoring vital signs and providing vital nutrients to newborns. Because most premature and sick newborns' lungs are not fully developed, NICU RNs must ensure that infants are breathing and maturing properly. These specialized nurses work with upper-level nurses and physicians and assist in treatment plans and examinations. They keep, maintain and update records of the patient's care. In addition to medical care, NICU RNs communicate with and educate parents on day-to-day operations as well as home-care procedures.
